## Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch in your fork.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Make your changes.
5. Build or watch `npm run build:watch`.
6. [Test](#Testing) your changes.
7. Ensure changes are built `npm run build`.
8. Commit and push your changes (including `dist`).
9. Create a PR to this repository.
10. Verify the tests pass, otherwise resolve.
11. Make sure to keep your branch up-to-date.

## Testing

GitHub is easier to set up, but you have to push your commits to test.  
Running locally is harder to set up, but it is much easier to test; and by far recommended!

### GitHub

Since `GITHUB_TOKEN` does NOT have to be added as a secret and is automatically generated every run there is nothing to do.

When you push your branch to your repository, the [test.yaml](.github/workflows/test.yaml) should run...

### Locally

To run actions locally you need to install act: https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html

1. Create a `.secrets` file with: `GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxx"`
2. Run: `act -j test`

Note: You need to have your current commit pushed as this makes a tag on GitHub to the current sha.
This means the `test` will most likely fail on a third-party PR since the automatic GITHUB_TOKEN won't have write access to content.

To see all available jobs run: `act -l`

# Actions Development

A GitHub Actions Primer: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions

For other Action types, see:

- JavaScript: https://github.com/smashedr/js-test-action
- TypeScript: https://github.com/smashedr/ts-test-action
- Docker: https://github.com/smashedr/docker-test-action
- Python: https://github.com/smashedr/py-test-action (DEPRECATED)

The heart of a GitHub Action is the [action.yml](action.yml) file. This describes everything about your action.

- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions

JavaScript Actions must be fully built in the action's environment. See the `build` in [package.json](package.json) for details.

## Actions Toolkit

The toolkit contains many parts. The `@actions/core` is required and this action uses the `@actions/github` module.

- https://github.com/actions/toolkit

This also uses `github.getOctokit`.

- https://octokit.github.io/rest.js

## Local Development

To run actions locally you need to install act: https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html

```shell
npm install
npm run build:watch
act -j test
```

Alternatively, to run from source, change `main` in [action.yml](action.yml) to `src/index.js` and
run: `act -j test --use-gitignore=false`

For advanced using with things like secrets, variables and context see: https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html

You should also review the options from `act --help`

Note, the `.env`, `.secrets` and `.vars` files are automatically sourced with no extra options.
To source `event.json` you need to run act with `act -e event.json`
